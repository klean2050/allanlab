- title: Deep Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Polyphonic Instrument Classification from Monophonic Raw Audio Waveforms
  image: Pub_327.png
  description: Sound Event Detection and Audio Classification tasks are traditionally addressed through time-frequency representations of audio signals such as spectrograms. However, the emergence of deep neural networks as efficient feature extractors has enabled the direct use of audio signals for classification purposes.

  description: In this paper we employ multifractal analysis to examine the behavior of EEG signals in terms of presence of fluctuations and the degree of fragmentation along their major frequency bands, for the task of emotion recognition.
