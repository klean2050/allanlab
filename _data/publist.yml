  description:
    Instrument classification is one of the fields in
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) that has attracted a lot of
research interest. However, the majority of that is dealing with
monophonic music, while efforts on polyphonic material mainly
focus on predominant instrument recognition. In this paper, we
propose an approach for instrument classification in polyphonic
music from purely monophonic data, that involves performing
data augmentation by mixing different audio segments. A variety
of data augmentation techniques focusing on different sonic
aspects, such as overlaying audio segments of the same genre, as
well as pitch and tempo-based synchronization, are explored. We
utilize Convolutional Neural Networks for the classification task,
comparing shallow to deep network architectures. We further investigate the usage of a combination of the above classifiers, each
trained on a single augmented dataset. An ensemble of VGG-like
classifiers, trained on non-augmented, pitch-synchronized, temposynchronized and genre-similar excerpts, respectively, yields the
best results, achieving slightly above 80% in terms of label
ranking average precision (LRAP) in the IRMAS test set.
