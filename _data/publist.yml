- title: Multiscale Fractal Analysis on EEG Signals for Music-Induced Emotion Recognition
  description: In this paper we employ multifractal analysis to examine the behavior of EEG signals in terms of presence of fluctuations and the degree of fragmentation along their major frequency bands, for the task of emotion recognition.

- title: Deep Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Polyphonic Instrument Classification from Monophonic Raw Audio Waveforms
  description: Sound Event Detection and Audio Classification tasks are traditionally addressed through time-frequency representations of audio signals such as spectrograms. However, the emergence of deep networks as efficient feature extractors has enabled the direct use of audio signals for classification purposes.

- title: Augmentation Methods on Monophonic Audio for Instrument Classification in Polyphonic Music
  description: In this paper, we propose an approach for instrument classification in polyphonic music from purely monophonic data, that involves performing data augmentation by mixing different audio segments.
