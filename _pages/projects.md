# Research Projects

My specialization lies in the fields of Signal Processing and Machine Learning Applications. Specifically, my research interests include:

* Audio and Biomedical Signal processing
* Behavioral Signals and Emotion Research
* Chaos, Fractals and Multifractal Signals
* Audio and Music Information Retrieval
* Representation Learning and Autoencoders
* Multimodal Learning and Cross-Modal Retrieval

Here are some themes I currently work on, or worked in the past:

### Affective Analysis on EEG and Music

...

### Musical Instrument Classification

...

### Master's Thesis

The topic of my Diploma Thesis is **Affective Analysis & Interpretation of Brain Responses to Music Stimuli** and it is divided into 2 main parts. The first one is dealing with multiscale and fractal analysis of EEG signals that have been stimulated by music. The goal is to take advantage of the complex scaling behavior of EEG in order to extract useful features that could relate to specific emotions. The second part, on which I am currently concentrated, is dealing with Cross-Modal Learning methods, where EEG and music waveforms are to be projected to a common latent space. Deriving such a meaningful space is important, as it provides information regarding how biological networks process stimulus data, and also enables cross-retrieval attempts. These involve matching stimuli to their corresponding EEG and simulating brain responses for specific music signals.
