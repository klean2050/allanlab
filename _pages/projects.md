# Research Projects

My specialization lies in the fields of Signal Processing and Machine Learning Applications. Specifically, my research interests include:

* Audio, Music and Biomedical Signal Processing
* Behavioral Signals and Emotion Research
* Chaos, Fractals and Multifractal Signals
* Representation Learning and Autoencoders
* Multimodal Learning and Cross-Modal Retrieval

Here are some themes I currently work on, or worked in the past:

### Affective Analysis on EEG and Music

The main research topic of my Diploma Thesis, *Affective Analysis & Interpretation of Brain Responses to Music Stimuli*. (...)  It is divided into 3 main parts:
* **Multifractal Analysis on EEG**: 
* **Deep Architectures for Emotion Recognition**:
* **EEG & Music Cross-Modal Learning**:
